# Resource Bridge
The Resource Bridge is intended to run onsite with limited compute power.
This device will proxy requests from the local `resources` to do things like update access lists on the local `resources` and push updates (e.g. logs) from the `resources` to the servers if need be.

This will allow the membership server to exist in the cloud somewhere and safe from the dangers of local mishaps.
